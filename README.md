# 🛒 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis using MySQL

## 📚 Project Overview
This project analyzes consumer behavior and shopping patterns using a real-world dataset of 3,900 customer records. The dataset provides detailed insights into customer demographics, purchase details, shopping habits, and preferences across various product categories and locations.

## 🎯 Objective
Explore and analyze the shopping behavior dataset by performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using MySQL queries to understand:
- Customer demographics and shopping frequency.
- Popular product categories and colors.
- Distribution of purchase amounts across seasons and locations.
- Patterns in payment methods, subscription status, and shipping type.

## ✅ Project Structure
- Database setup in MySQL
- Dataset imported into a single table (`shopping_data')
- SQL queries written to perform:
    - Aggregations (e.g., average purchase amount by age group)
    - Grouped analysis (e.g., most popular categories and colors)
    - Frequency of purchase distribution
    - CTEs and self-joins to explore advanced patterns

## 📊 Sample Insights
- Weekly and Monthly purchases are most common frequencies.
- Certain categories like Clothing and Footwear are most popular.
